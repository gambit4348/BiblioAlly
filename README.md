# BiblioAlly

## Welcome to BiblioAlly

**BiblioAlly** is designed to support the Literature Review process usually conducted in scientific research. The ones that
have already go throughout such a workflow know how time-consuming and exhausting such a work can be.

The current state of **BiblioAlly** covers only a few steps of the process and certainly has a long way to go before it
can be considered to give a comprehensive support. However, even that is provided now can be
considered as helpful for those who have to produce a Literature Review.

Detailed information about **BiblioAlly** can be found in its [wiki](https://github.com/gambit4348/BiblioAlly/wiki)
page on GitHub.
